This project is only used for doing the question in the “剑指Offer” book which is a great book for people preparing their tech interviews. This book also has lots different
versions for different Programming lanaguages. 


This project will be written in two languages （Java and Python).



I am sharing my own code for doing the questions in these book, there maybe some bugs or some mistakes, if you find it plz let me know :). 

If you are also interested in these question I can share the copy of the book with you and we can do it together. :D

I am superrrr busy with my Master Project right now. SO maybe this project will have a very limited progress everyday. But I promise I will finish all the questions in the book 
before September :D.


All the best for all the coders trying to find a good job :D
